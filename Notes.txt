JavaScript Notes:

* Data Types
- Primitive: Number, String, Boolean, Undefined, Null, BigInt, Symbol
- Non Primitive: Object

* Type conversion: 
- Implicit (Coercion)
- Explicit (Type casting)

* Deleting element at certain index
let arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
let indexToRemove = 2;
let newArr = [...arr.slice(0, indexToRemove), ...arr.slice(indexToRemove + 1)];
console.log(newArr); // Output: [1, 2, 4, 5]

* Events
### Mouse Events
1. **onMouseover**: Triggered when the mouse pointer moves over an element.
2. **onMouseenter**: Similar to `onMouseover`, but it does not bubble (i.e., it only triggers when the mouse enters the element itself, not its child elements).
3. **onMouseleave**: Triggered when the mouse pointer leaves an element.
### Keyboard Events
1. **onKeyPress**: Triggered when a key is pressed down and then released. It is generally used for capturing character input.
2. **onKeyUp**: Triggered when a key is released.
3. **onKeyDown**: Triggered when a key is pressed down.
### Simple Events
1. **onClick**: Triggered when an element is clicked.
2. **onChange**: Triggered when the value of an input element changes (e.g., text input, select box).
3. **onSubmit**: Triggered when a form is submitted.
